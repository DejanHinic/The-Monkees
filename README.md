## Technologies Used


- html5 https://www.w3schools.com/html/ 
- css https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp for styling
- bootstrap 4 https://getbootstrap.com/ to build the grid and make it responsive for all devices
- Balsamiq for wireframe  https://balsamiq.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwndvlBRANEiwABrR32Mzzb1wWuG0slcCQDwB1B2W9OBv8pacL7BzOZ9sGnPggguab1vbt4BoCTewQAvD_BwE 

## Testing

- home page
it looks responsive on all devices
there is picture HIRE US from slide 3
it seems that is having a sml visual problem when carusel is sliding it appears white bottom padding i believe it is because format of 
picture but not 100% sure. I liked that picture so i didnt want to change it

- about us
all links are responsive and containers
only in mobile phone view i let it to float little bit on the left, I am still thinking about it, is it nice like that or not

- multimedia
Tested spotyfy and all videos they doing well on all devices
on xs view looks that videos are maybe too close to each other
all links working fine
